                statement={`You are given a straight line on a 2D plane in the form of (ax + by + c = 0) and an array of points of the form (Xi, Yi). Your task is to find a point on the given line for which the sum of distances from this point to the given array/list of points is minimum.
                Here the equation for the given line is x - y = 0, i.e. a = 1, b = -1 and c = 0. 
                There are two points, i.e. (-1, 1) and (1, -1).
                So, the point on the line that has minimum distances from the points is (0, 0). The sum of distances is sqrt(1 + 1) + sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2) + sqrt(2) = 2.83 (rounding to 2 decimal digits).`}

                input={`The first line contains an integer 'T', which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then, the T test cases follow.
                The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers denoting a, b and c, respectively, representing the equation of the given line as mentioned above.
                The second line of each test case contains a single integer N, denoting the number of coordinates.
                Then N lines follow. Each line contains two space-separated integers denoting the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of the point, respectively.`}
                output={`For each test case, print the minimum possible distance.
                Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesnâ€™t exceed 10^-6.
